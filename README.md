# Todo
Todo is a simple desktop application to record your important tasks, so that you do not forget them. This small application has been created by using python3, PySide2, SQLite3, PyCharm Community Edition. The application has been developed and tested in Linux Mint only. As coding is my hobby, I have created this application to test my knowledge on Python3 and on all other libraries mentioned above. I am using this application in Linux Mint using the freezing tool, PyInstaller. I hope the codes used in this application will help other Python3 and PySide2 developers who are absolutely new to these fields.
